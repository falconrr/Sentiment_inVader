I needed a scooter that could power up the hills of downtown Seattle, and the Widewheel Pro is a perfect fit!
Seattle has a new scooter rental program, but half the time I would end up paying to push a scooter up the worst of the hills...they just didn't have enough power.
The Widewheel Pro is a bit bigger than the average electric scooter but so stable and powerful with great style. I can zip up and down from Pike Place Market to the top of Capitol Hill and look great doing so...this scooter definitely turns heads while zooming up the seemingly endless downtown climbs!
Caring and responsive customer service makes this an even more valuable purchase.
